                used to define the text styling for the different hierarchies.
                As part of the planning for the project I started out drawing up

                this was a case where we had to create a dynamic website with a
                sort, filter and search functionality. the primary focus was

              <p class="project-text-body">
                through this project I learned how to handle data that might not
                match what you expected, which I assume isn’t all that unusual
                in a real world scenario. the provided json object containing
                the data had mixed up capitalization and a varying number of
                names etc.

              <p class="project-text-body">
                the main focus for the this project was manipulating strings and
                arrays with JavaScript. firstly, I had to split the full names
                into first name, middle name, nickname and last name. these
                names then had to be capitalized and added to an object and then
                to an array. the way I manipulated arrays was by using multiple
                array functions, such as sort, compare, filter etc. which was
                the foundation for the sort and filter mechanisms.

                even though the primary focus of this project was the
                JavaScript, I wanted the style to reflect my understanding of
                harry potter. I did so by using the official color schemes for
                the houses as well as a parchment beige for the main layout. The
                font is meant to look typewritten and through that represent the
                time and universe the story is set in
