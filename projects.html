                this projects main focus was to celebrate innovation, and to do
                so I, together with my team, chose to bring focus to some
                ground-breaking advancements in the use of electricity that has
                affected the way we live today. <br />therefore the first event
                that took place as early as 1752 and then they gradually move on
                to the modern days.

                my main focus for the visualization for this project was to find
                a way to guide the users eye from one event to the other. the
                way I did so was to make the transition between each event a
                morph of sorts. this means that the primary outline takes on new
                forms throughout the experience but is never erased and drawn
                again. This was accomplished using flubber.js and d3.js.

                in order to increase legibility i made sure that each function
                only does one thing and the more complicated part of the code i
                was able to blackbox inside modules. I was also able to utilize
                Sass and the possibility to use mixins, which I specifically
                used to define the text styling for the different hierarchies.
                As part of the planning for the project I started out drawing up
                an activity diagram in order to visualize the code required to
                support the user journey.

                through this project I learned how to handle data that might not
                match what you expected, which I assume isn’t all that unusual
                in a real world scenario. the provided json object containing
                the data had mixed up capitalization and a varying number of
                names etc.

                the main focus for the this project was manipulating strings and
                arrays with JavaScript. firstly, I had to split the full names
                into first name, middle name, nickname and last name. these
                names then had to be capitalized and added to an object and then
                to an array. the way I manipulated arrays was by using multiple
                array functions, such as sort, compare, filter etc. which was
                the foundation for the sort and filter mechanisms.

                even though the primary focus of this project was the
                JavaScript, I wanted the style to reflect my understanding of
                harry potter. I did so by using the official color schemes for
                the houses as well as a parchment beige for the main layout. The
                font is meant to look typewritten and through that represent the
                time and universe the story is set in

                the message our client wanted the website to communicate was the
                different ways we humans think. The user would be presented with
                a dilemma and after answering the page would change and display
                how other humans responded to the dilemma.

                an important point for our client was that the website didn’t
                show any sort of bias that could manipulate the users decision.
                I.g. no political colors or flashy animations, which led us down
                a path of very neutral colors. the answer columns’ animation is
                made to create anticipation for the user before knowing the
                answer percentages.

                this whole project is still in it’s beginning phase. the current
                plan for future iterations is to first make the website run as a
                single page application instead of how it’s currently build.
                Furthermore, it will be linked up with a database to store
                answers and comments so the percentages shown are reflecting
                real responses.

                the client had no strong demands for the design, the only
                requirement he had was that he didn’t want it to look like a
                generic shop. <br />
                we took this and came up with the concept of a online gallery,
                where instead of scroll down though the art you “walk”
                horizontally like you would in a actual art gallery.

                a main point for the website was that the client would be able
                to maintain it himself once we were done with the build.
                therefore it is dynamically updated using wordpress as a
                headless CMS. each painting and description is one entry and is
                easily updated.<br />
                Furthermore, the horizontal movement of the gallery page is
                trickered by vertical scroll (similar to the scroll on this
                page), which is achieved with an empty div, which is as tall as
                the content container is wide.

                this was the area of great importance, as we really found out
                what was working and what wasn’t. we had to kill some of our
                darlings to fit the needs of the target audience and fine tune
                our aspirations so that the final outcome would provide the best
                possible user experience for our market. among others, we used
                the tree test and card sorting in order to perfect our
                information architecture, as well as a trunk test to determine
                the navigability of our page.
